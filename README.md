maps
====

Antique map images georeferenced and projected on modern vector maps for 
android mapping applications.

Why:
For their beauty, and the historic perspective they provide while 
strolling along the streets of old towns. 

The images:
Large, hires scanned, historic paper maps. 
Maps from 1400 to 1800 of North Western cities made thru etching, 
mostly colored and drawn in birds eye perspective, (vedute images).
Beautifull art work with usefull but limited accuracy. 

The maps:
The map images are georeferenced (warped/stretched) to their current coordinates (WGS84).
Their accuracy is limited but practically usefull and many times surprisingly good.
This due to historic technical limitations, the destuctive passing of time and 
mapstyling: birds eye perspective degrades accuracy near horizont.
Best viewed on tablets in not so bright sunlight, works with GPS.
North West European cities are mostly covered.
Precision better than 50 meters.
Supported mapping apps: Locus map, OsmAnd mapping.
